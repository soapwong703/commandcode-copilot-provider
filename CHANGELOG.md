# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Features

- Replace the bundled model list with the public Command Code catalog, synced with first-party model capability and pricing docs every 24 hours. The existing **Command Code: Refresh Models** command forces a sync.
- Show reference credits per 1M tokens in the model picker, including long-context tiers when they carry a surcharge, a price-category tag, the active peak/off-peak billing period with its next transition, and active discounts.
- Model discovery and documentation sync no longer require an API key; a key is still required to make chat requests.
- Remove the bundled model registry so retired provider models no longer remain in the picker.

## 0.3.0 (2026-09-22)

### Features

- **Grok 4.7** added to the maintained model registry — coding and knowledge work built for multi-hour tasks with a 500K context window, surfaced with verified tool-calling, native vision and thinking-effort capabilities in the picker.
- **MiMo V2.6 Flash** added to the maintained model registry — efficient multimodal agentic coding with a 1.05M context window, surfaced with verified tool-calling, native vision and thinking-effort capabilities in the picker.
- **MiMo V2.6 Pro** added to the maintained model registry — flagship multimodal agentic coding with a 1.05M context window, surfaced with verified tool-calling, native vision and thinking-effort capabilities in the picker.
- **MiMo V2.6 Pro UltraSpeed** added to the maintained model registry — the low-latency serving tier of MiMo V2.6 Pro with a 1.05M context window, surfaced with verified tool-calling, native vision and thinking-effort capabilities in the picker.
- **Qwen 3.8 Omni Flash** added to the maintained model registry — omni-modal understanding and multimedia agentic work with a 1M context window, surfaced with verified tool-calling, native vision and thinking-effort capabilities in the picker.

### Fixes

- **`:free` variants are now classified as free.** Command Code marks limited-time free models with either a `-free` or a `:free` id suffix, but only the `-free` form was recognized — auto-discovered models ending in `:free` (e.g. `meituan/LongCat-2.0:free`) were shown as ordinary fetched entries. Both suffixes now yield the **"(fetched, free)"** marker in the picker.

## 0.2.9 (2026-09-10)

### Features

- **DeepSeek V4.1 Flash** added to the maintained model registry — V4.1 hybrid-attention reasoning with native vision and a 1M context window, surfaced with verified tool-calling, native vision and thinking-effort capabilities in the picker.

## 0.2.8 (2026-09-07)

### Features

- **GPT-6 Astra** added to the maintained model registry — the most capable OpenAI model for demanding reasoning and agents, with a 1.05M context window, surfaced with verified tool-calling, native vision and thinking-effort capabilities in the picker.

## 0.2.7 (2026-09-03)

### Features

- **DeepSeek V4 Flash Fast** added to the maintained model registry — ultra-fast low-cost hybrid-attention reasoning with a 1M context window, surfaced with verified tool-calling and thinking-effort capabilities in the picker.
- **Gemini 3.8 Flash** added to the maintained model registry — the latest Gemini Flash with a 1M context window, surfaced with verified tool-calling, native vision and thinking-effort capabilities in the picker.
- **LongCat 2.0 (free)** added to the maintained model registry — the first Meituan model, a free long-context reasoning option with a 1M context window, surfaced with verified tool-calling and thinking-effort capabilities in the picker.
- **Muse Spark 1.3 & 1.3 Contributor** added to the maintained model registry — the latest open agentic models with a 1M context window, surfaced with verified tool-calling, native vision and thinking-effort capabilities in the picker.
- **Qwen 3.8 Max 0902** added to the maintained model registry — the refreshed Qwen 3.8 Max build with a 1M context window, surfaced with verified tool-calling, native vision and thinking-effort capabilities in the picker.

## 0.2.6 (2026-09-02)

### Features

- **Claude Fable 5.1** added to the maintained model registry — the newest frontier Anthropic model with a 1M context window, surfaced with verified tool-calling, native vision and thinking-effort capabilities in the picker.

## 0.2.5 (2026-08-27)

### Features

- **GLM-5.3 Flash** added to the maintained model registry — fast, affordable GLM coding with a 1M context window, surfaced with verified tool-calling, native vision and thinking-effort capabilities in the picker.
- **Qwen 3.8 Flash** added to the maintained model registry — fast low-cost agentic coding with native vision and reasoning, surfaced with verified capabilities in the picker.

## 0.2.4 (2026-08-26)

### Features

- **DeepSeek V4 Flash Vision (exp)** added to the maintained model registry — fast hybrid-attention reasoning with native image input, surfaced with verified capabilities in the picker.
- **Capabilities in the model card** — the hover tooltip card now lists every model's capabilities (Vision · Reasoning) instead of only the marketing description, so you can tell at a glance what a model supports.
- **Fetched model ids in the model card** — auto-discovered models now show their full upstream model id (e.g. `minimax/minimax-m3-free`) in the tooltip card, and free variants (id ending in `-free`) are named **"(fetched, free)"** in the picker so they can't be confused with the paid model of the same name.

## 0.2.3 (2026-08-22)

### Fixes

- **ZRD Header** ZDR (Zero data retention) did not work properly because the header that was sent, was not correct.

## 0.2.2 (2026-08-21)

### Fixes

- **Clipboard-pasted images are now visible to vision-capable models.** Multimodal user messages were serialized with image parts in a non-standard `parts` field alongside `content`, which OpenAI-compatible servers ignore — so images pasted directly into the chat prompt were silently dropped (only file-based images worked, since those reach the model via tool calls). Image parts are now embedded in the `content` array per the chat-completions spec: `content: [{ type: 'text' }, { type: 'image_url' }, ...]`.
- Added diagnostics for image handling: a warning is logged when an image part is dropped because the selected model does not advertise image input, and a debug message is logged when image parts are attached to a request.

## 0.2.1 (2026-08-20)

### Features

- Added the `commandcode-copilot.modelDetailStyle` setting (default `auto`) to control the text shown beside model names in the model picker: `full` (long description), `compact` (short capability text such as "Vision · Thinking"), or `hidden` (name only). The full description stays available in the hover tooltip.

### Fixes

- On Linux, long detail text no longer collapses model names in the picker — `auto` shows compact capability text on Linux and the full description elsewhere.

## 0.2.0 (2026-08-20)

### Features

- Live model-catalog sync: Auto-discovers new models from the live catalog and surfaces them in the picker (marked `(fetched)`), assuming conservative defaults (vision + reasoning enabled, output estimated from the context window) until verified. Also fetches context windows for known/configured models and updates them if changes occur. Fetched once from `GET /provider/v1/models`, persisted in extension storage, and refreshed only on demand via **Command Code: Refresh Models**.
- Persisted catalog snapshot falls back to the bundled model registry when no API key is set or the sync fails.-

### Fixes

- Corrected the context window reported for every model in the catalog to match the live `context_length` served by `/provider/v1/models` (e.g. DeepSeek V4 Flash/Pro now report 1M, the GPT-5.4 family 400K, Grok 4.5/4.6 500K).
- Muse Spark 1.1 / 1.2 / 1.2 Contributor now report their real 1M context window and 128K max output tokens (previously shown as 288K context / 32K output).

## 0.1.1 (2026-08-19)

### Features

- Added `Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B` to the model catalog (262K context, vision, reasoning).

## 0.1.0 (2026-08-17)

### Features

- Initial release — Command Code for Copilot Chat provider.
- Pulls live model list from `GET /provider/v1/models` and exposes them in the Copilot Chat model picker.
- Streaming Chat Completions over the OpenAI-compatible `/provider/v1/chat/completions` endpoint.
- BYOK API key stored in VS Code SecretStorage.
- Per-model thinking effort selector (`none`, `low`, `medium`, `high`).
- Vision-capable models receive image parts natively (no proxy required).
- Optional zero-data-retention header (`x-cmdc-zdr: 1`).
