# Command Code for Copilot Chat

Access Command Code models directly inside Copilot Chat — no new UI, no workflow changes.

**Already enjoying Command Code's pricing but missing Copilot's agent capabilities, tool integrations, and familiar interface?** This extension brings the entire Command Code model lineup into the Copilot Chat model selector, complete with **image understanding**, **adjustable reasoning depth**, and secure API key management.

## Why use this?

- **Extend Copilot, don't replace it.** There's no extra sidebar or interface to figure out — just additional models appearing in the dropdown you already know.
- **Full Copilot feature support.** Agent workflows, tool execution, custom instructions, MCP servers, and skills all continue to work seamlessly on Command Code models.
- **Direct image understanding.** Models from Claude, GPT, Gemini, Kimi, Qwen, and Grok handle image inputs natively through Command Code — no intermediate proxy or re-encoding step.
- **Bring your own key.** You control the billing, rate limits, and account. Credentials are persisted in the OS keychain, never written to config files or version control. The live model list and public first-party metadata sync do not require a key.

## Capabilities

### Complete model catalog in the picker

Every model available through Command Code's provider API appears right next to built-in options in the Copilot Chat selector — including Claude Opus 5, Claude Sonnet 5, GPT-5.5/5.6/6, Gemini 3.7 Flash, DeepSeek V4 Pro/Flash (incl. V4.1 Flash and Flash Vision exp), Kimi K3, Qwen 3.8 Max/Flash/Omni Flash, MiMo V2.6 Pro/Flash, GLM-5.3 & GLM-5.3 Flash, Grok 4.7, and many others. You can swap models in the middle of a conversation without resetting context.

### Live model discovery

The extension synchronizes the public Command Code model API, model-capability docs, and pricing docs every 24 hours. Run **Command Code: Refresh Models** to force a sync at any time. The model catalog is available even before you configure an API key; a key is required only to send chat requests.

- **Context stays accurate** — every model's reported context window mirrors the live `context_length` from the provider API.
- **No stale models** — the API is authoritative for which models exist, so removed models disappear and new models appear automatically.
- **Capabilities and pricing stay current** — first-party docs supply vision, reasoning, descriptions, per-million-token rates, context tiers, peak rates, and active deals.
- **Pricing in the model picker** — each model reports its credit costs per 1M tokens, so VS Code's picker renders a rate table (with long-context tiers when they are actually surcharged) plus a price tag such as **Low cost**. Models with peak/off-peak billing show the active period and when it changes; discounted models show the active discount. Listed prices are reference rates.

### Per-model reasoning control

Models that support extended reasoning display a **Thinking effort** selector right inside the Copilot interface:

- `Off` — skip reasoning entirely for maximum speed
- `Light` — minimal reasoning suited to quick adjustments
- `Standard` — balanced reasoning for general-purpose use
- `Deep` — thorough reasoning aimed at challenging problems

This preference is forwarded to the upstream provider as `reasoning_effort` and scoped to the currently selected model — no separate global configuration needed.

### Image input support

Models with vision capabilities (Claude Opus/Sonnet 5, GPT-5.4+, Gemini, Kimi K3, Qwen 3.7+, Grok 4.5, and others) accept image attachments directly in the conversation — no encoding workaround, no added round-trip delay.

### Full Copilot integration

Since this extension registers through Copilot's built-in provider interface, every native capability remains available:

- **Agent mode** — handle complex, multi-step workflows autonomously
- **Tool calling** — edit files, run terminal commands, search the workspace, interact with Git, execute tests
- **Instructions & skills** — your `.instructions.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and custom skills continue to function normally
- **Zero-data-retention** — enable with a single toggle; traffic is directed exclusively through ZDR-compliant endpoints

### Credential security

API keys are stored using VS Code's `SecretStorage`, which leverages the operating system's native keychain (Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain, Linux Secret Service). Keys are never persisted in `settings.json` or exposed through version control.

### No added dependencies

Built entirely on VS Code's extension API and Node.js standard library. There's no reliance on Python runtimes, Docker containers, or locally hosted proxy servers.

## Getting Started

### What you need

- VS Code version 1.116 or newer (the extension uses the same provider API surface that powers Copilot Chat)
- An active GitHub Copilot subscription (Free, Pro, or Enterprise tiers all work — including the free plan)
- A Command Code subscription with API access enabled (GOAT, Pro, Max, Team, or Provider tiers) — details on the [pricing page](https://commandcode.ai/docs/resources/pricing-limits)

### Install

1. **VS Code** — grab it from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Tyrannmisu.commandcode-copilot-provider).
2. **Other editors on Open VSX** — available on [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/Tyrannmisu/commandcode-copilot-provider).

### First steps

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run **Command Code: Set API Key**.
2. Enter your Command Code API key (generate one at [Studio](https://commandcode.ai/studio/)).
3. Launch Copilot Chat, open the model dropdown, and select a **Command Code** model.
4. Optionally adjust the **Thinking effort** level via the control beside the model name.
5. Start chatting.

Reasoning depth is adjusted per model through the Copilot Chat model selector.

Sample `settings.json` for a mirrored endpoint that uses alternate model names:

```json
{
  "commandcode-copilot.baseUrl": "https://my-mirror.example.com/v1",
  "commandcode-copilot.modelIdOverrides": {
    "claude-sonnet-5": "claude-sonnet-5-mirror",
    "gpt-5.5": "gpt-5-5-mirror"
  }
}
```

Sample `settings.json` with zero-data-retention enabled:

```json
{
  "commandcode-copilot.zdr": true
}
```
